    Authority Score Calculation

    This system improves document ranking and recommendation quality by introducing
    an Authority Score, which measures a documentâ€™s importance within the citation network.

    The Authority Score combines three complementary signals:

    1. PageRank:
       - Computed using the PageRank algorithm on the document citation graph.
       - Measures influence: a document cited by highly influential documents receives a higher PageRank.
       - Captures both direct and indirect importance.

    2. Citation Count:
       - Counts how many documents cite the given document.
       - Measures raw popularity, independent of the quality of the citing documents.
       - Helps identify documents that are widely referenced even if by less influential sources.

    3. Recency score:
       - Recent documents are boosted slightly to account for the fact that they haven't had time to be cited yet.

    Normalization:
    - PageRank values are min-max normalized across the full corpus to scale to [0, 1].
    - Citation counts are log-transformed using log(1 + count) to reduce the effect of extreme outliers,
      and then min-max normalized to [0, 1].

    Combination:
    The final Authority Score is calculated as a weighted sum:
        authority_score = 0.6 * normalized_pagerank + 0.3 * normalized_log_citation_count + 0.1 * recency

    - PageRank is weighted more heavily to prioritize influence over popularity.
    - The weighting can be tuned based on empirical ranking quality.

    Purpose:
    - This blended score favors documents that are both influential and widely cited.
    - It reduces bias toward obscure but heavily cited documents or important but rarely cited ones.
    - It produces a more reliable and balanced authority signal for improving semantic search,
      related document suggestions, and content discovery.

    The Authority Score is precomputed and stored with document metadata, and later combined
    with other signals such as semantic similarity and document recency during re-ranking.
