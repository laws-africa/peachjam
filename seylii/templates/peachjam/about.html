    The Seychelles Legal Information Institute (SeyLII) offers free and anonymous access to case law, legislation and secondary legal materials from the Seychelles.
    SeyLII is an independent, self-funded organisation and needs your support.

    SeyLII was established in 2012 under the auspices of the Judiciary of Seychelles and with the support of AfricanLII.  It became an independent registered association in 2015.
    SEYLII is a member of the international Free Access to Law Movement and subscribes to the principles of the <a href="http://www.fatlm.org/declaration/">Declaration on Free Access to Law</a>.

    The vision of SeyLII is to be the primary legal resource institution in Seychelles, providing free, reliable online access to essential Seychelles legal resources.
    These core resources have not previously been readily or cheaply available to most citizens of Seychelles. They make it easier for practitioners and judges to research the law, to prepare cases for hearing,
    and to write fairly researched judgments and decisions, and for lawyers and non-lawyers (both local and international) to understand and monitor the changing nature of Seychellesâ€™ legal environment.

    In addition to providing a portal for case law and legislation, SeyLII aims to increase public awareness of the operations of the domestic courts and the broader legal profession,
    thereby improving access to the courts and strengthening public confidence in the administration of justice.
