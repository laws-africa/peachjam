      The Uganda Law Reports were last published in 1973.
      The East African Law Reports went out of print in 1975.
      Though it recently made a come back, it does not reflect the last series that covered East African courts fairly and comprehensively with the courts of all three countries participating in the editorial work.
      The current series mainly concentrate on reporting Kenya court decisions.

      The situation has simply been disastrous for the last three decades for a common law jurisdiction where making of decisions by courts is governed by the doctrine of precedents.

    <strong>{% trans 'Access to law' %}</strong>
  </h5>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Online access through the internet can be in an office, at home, computer labs in schools, institution of learning or public internet cafes.
      It is this medium that is proposed to be utilized to provide access to Ugandaâ€™s primary and secondary legal materials on the following principles of the declaration of free access to law:
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Publication of legal information from all countries and international institutions is part of the common heritage of humanity.
        Maximizing access to this information promotes justice and the rule of law.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Public legal information is digital common property and should be accessible to all free of charge.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Independent non-profit organisations have the right to publish public legal information and the government bodies that create or control that information should provide access to it so that it can be published.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      In the manner of the worldwide movement of legal information institutes, it was proposed that we organize to:
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Publish via the internet primary materials including statutes from government/parliament, case law from all courts of record and treaties entered into by the government of Uganda whether ratified by parliament or not.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Publish secondary legal materials like reports of the Uganda Law Reform Commission and other bodies.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Provide free, full and anonymous public access to the said information.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Though there are no figures that show the connectivity of the legal community to the internet specifically, a significant number of offices in the judiciary, government law offices, parliament, DPP, academia and the public are connected to the internet.
      With this access it is anticipated that legal resources which has until now been unavailable in an organized manner or at all to the public and the legal profession would become available, increasing access to law, thus access to justice and the rule of law.
