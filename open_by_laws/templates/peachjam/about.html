    Open By-laws is a part of <a href="https://lawlibrary.org.za">LawLibrary.org.za</a>. It makes our by-laws easier to find, read and share.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    Municipal by-laws form part of the legal foundation for effective
    service delivery and cooperative communities. In many municipalities,
    however, the by-laws are out of date or difficult to find. Open By-laws
    helps to solve this problem by making up-to-date by-laws freely available to everyone.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    Open By-laws is a project by <a href="https://laws.africa">Laws.Africa</a> and <a href="https://africanlii.org">AfricanLII</a>.

  <h3>{% trans 'What are by-laws?' %}</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    By-laws are laws managed by municipalities. <a href="https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/act/1996/constitution/eng@2013-08-23#chp_7">The Constitution of South Africa</a> gives municipalities the power to pass their own legislation, in the form of by-laws, for particular subject areas. These by-laws hold the same power and force as other national and provincial legislation.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Municipalities are required by the Municipal Systems Act to make their by-laws publicly available on their website. However, most municipalities lack the capacity to do so. Open By-laws helps to fill this gap.
